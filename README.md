## 📊 Machine Learning Pipeline

### 🔍 Data Processing

```python
skills_text = skills_text.lower().strip()
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(all_skills)
```

### 🎯 Clustering Algorithm

```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
```

### 📈 Similarity Matching

```python
similarities = cosine_similarity(user_skills, industry_skills)
best_match = similarities.argmax()
```
